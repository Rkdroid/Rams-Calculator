Calculation of Mathematical Expressions using shunting-yard algorithm and Recursive Descent Parser
calculator parser using the shunting-yard algorithm and a tokenizer, plus an evaluator to calculate the results.
It supports sqrt function, more functions can be added.

Integrated with junit test.

To Evaluate an expression using shunting-yard algorithm use
```java
ArithmeticEvaluator.evaluate(expression);
```

To Evaluate an expression using Recursive Descent Parser use
```java
RdpCalculator.evaluate(expression);
```
